//! Module for reading and recreation of JPEGs without the loss of any information.
//!
//! This means that it should be possible to reconstruct bit-by-bit an exactly identical
//! JPEG file from the input.
//!
//! Note that we never actually decode the JPEG into pixels, since the DCT is lossy, so
//! processing needs to be done at the DCT coefficient level and keep the coefficients in
//! the BlockBasedImage identical.
