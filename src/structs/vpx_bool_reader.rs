    // Lepton uses VP8 adaptive arithmetic coding scheme, where bits are extracted from file stream
    // by division of current 8-bit stream `value` by adaptive 8-bit `split`. Adaptation is achieved by
    // combination of predicted probability to get false bit (`1 <= probability <= 255`, in 1/256 units),
    // and `range` that represents maximum possible value of yet-not-decoded stream part (so that
    // `range > value`, `128 <= range <= 256` in units of $2^{-n-8}$ for the `n` bits already decoded)
    // by forming predictor `split = 1 + (((range - 1) * probability) >> BITS_IN_BYTE)`,
    // `1 <= split <= range - 1`. Comparison of predictor with stream gives the next decoded bit:
    // true for `value >= split` and false otherwise - this is effectively division step.
    // After this we shrink `value` and `range` by `split` for true or shrink `range` to `split`
    // for false and update `probability`. Now `range` can get out of allowable range and we restore it
    // by shifting left both `range` and `value` with corresponding filling of `value` by further
    // stream bits (it corresponds to bring down new digit in division). Repeat until stream ends.
    //
    // Reference: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6386#section-7.
    //
    // Here some imrovements to the basic scheme are implemented. First, we store more stream bits
    // in `value` to reduce refill rate, so that 8 MSBs of `value` represent `value` of the scheme
    // (it was already implemented in DropBox version, however, with shorter 16-bit `value`).
    // Second, `range` and `split` are also stored in 8 MSBs of the same size variables (it is new
    // and it allows to reduce number of operations to compute `split` - previously `big_split` -
    // and to update `range` and `shift`).
